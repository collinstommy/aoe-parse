## ONLINE MATCHMAKING

Of course you can buy and play the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/813780/Age_of_Empires_II_Definitive_Edition/) which is what most people do these days, however before the days of AOE2 on Steam (and post MSZone) people used to play on [Voobly](https://www.voobly.com/games/view/Age-of-Empires-II-The-Conquerors) * and many still do. If you want to play on Voobly, but have the games on steam you may want to take a look at [AoE2 Tools](https://github.com/gregstein/AoE2Tools).
